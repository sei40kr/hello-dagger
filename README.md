| [@Component](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Component.html)                       | Tells Dagger to implement an `interface` or `abstract class` that creates and returns one or more application objects.                                                                                                                                            |
| [@Inject](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/inject/Inject.html)                 | Tells Dagger how to instantiate that class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [@Module](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Module.html)                             | Acts as collections of instructions for Dagger on how to construct dependencies. They're called modules because they are modular.                                                                                                                                 |
| [@Binds](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Binds.html)                               | Tells Dagger how to construct an instance. They are abstract methods on modules that associate one type that Dagger already knows how to construct (the method's parameter) with a type that Dagger doesn't yet know how to construct (the method's return type). |
| [@Provides](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Provides.html)                         | Tells Dagger that when something requests an instance of the type the method returns, it should call that method to get an instance. Like `@Inject` constructors, they can have parameters: those parameters are their dependencies.                              |
| [@IntoMap](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/multibindings/IntoMap.html)             | Allows for the creation of a map with values of a specific type, with keys set using special annotations such as `@StringKey` or `@IntKey`. Because keys are set via annotation, Dagger ensures that multiple values are not mapped to the same key.              |
| [@IntoSet](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/multibindings/IntoSet.html)             | Allows for the creation for of a set of types to be collected together. It can be used together with `@Binds` and `@Provides` methods to provide a `Set<ReturnType>`.                                                                                             |
| [@Singleton](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/inject/Singleton.html)           | Instructs Dagger to create only one instance of the type for each instance of the component. It can be used on the class declaration of a type that has an `@Inject` constructor, or on a `@Binds` or `@Provides` method.                                         |
| [@Subcomponent](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Subcomponent.html)                 | Like `@Component`, it uses modules to give Dagger implementation instructions. Subcomponents always have a parent component (or a parent subcomponent), and any objects that are requestable in the parent are requestable in the child, but not vice versa.      |
| [@Subcomponent.Factory](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Subcomponent.Factory.html) | Creates instances of subcomponent. An instance of it is requestable in the parent component.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [@BindsInstance](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/BindsInstance.html)               | Let you make arbitary objects requestable by other binding methods in the component.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [@Qualifier](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/inject/Inject.html)              | Used to differentiate between instances of the same type that are unrelated.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [@Scope](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Scope.html)                               | Instructs Dagger to provide one shared instance for all the requests for that type within an instance of the (sub)component that shares the same annotation.                                                                                                      |
| [@BindsOptionalOf](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/BindsOptionalOf.html)           | Tells Dagger that it can construct instances of `Optional<ReturnType>`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
